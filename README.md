Analyzing Unemployment Trends during the COVID-19 Pandemic:

Hi everyone..this project simulates unemployment rates from 2018 to 2023, incorporating seasonal trends and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The code generates a synthetic dataset, calculates unemployment rates, and visualizes the trend with a highlighted COVID-19 period.

Key Features:

- Simulation of unemployment rates with seasonal trends and pandemic impact
- Data visualization using Matplotlib to illustrate the unemployment trend
- Highlighting the COVID-19 period (March 2020 to March 2022) in the visualization

Code Highlights:

- Generating synthetic unemployment rate data using Pandas and NumPy
- Calculating unemployment rates with seasonal trends and pandemic impact
- Visualizing the unemployment trend with a line plot and highlighted COVID-19 period

Usage:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the code to generate the synthetic dataset and visualization

Libraries Used:

- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Matplotlib for data visualization
