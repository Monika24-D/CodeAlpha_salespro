# CodeAlpha_salespro

Hi everyone..this project analyzes the relationship between ad spending, platform, and segment on predicted sales. The code creates a sample dataset, maps platform and segment scores, calculates predicted sales, and visualizes the relationship between ad spending and predicted sales.

#Key Features:

- Data creation and manipulation using Pandas
- Mapping platform and segment scores to calculate predicted sales
- Data visualization using Matplotlib to illustrate the relationship between ad spending and predicted sales

#Code Highlights:

- Sample dataset creation with ad spending, platform, and segment data
- Calculation of predicted sales based on platform and segment scores
- Visualization of ad spending vs predicted sales using a line plot with markers

#Usage:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the code to generate the sample dataset and visualization

#Libraries Used:

- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Matplotlib for data visualization
